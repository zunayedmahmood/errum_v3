## 1. Product Lifecycle

The Product Lifecycle dictates the visibility and operational availability of a catalog item across the E-commerce storefront and POS.

### Flowchart
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft: Created
    Draft --> Active: Publish
    Active --> Archived: Discontinue/Hide
    Archived --> Active: Restore
    Archived --> SoftDeleted: Trash
    SoftDeleted --> Archived: Recover
    SoftDeleted --> PermanentDelete: Purge (After 7 Days)
    PermanentDelete --> [*]
```

### Detailed Phases
- **Draft:** The product is being created. Basic details (title, SKU) are entered, but images or variants may be missing. Not visible to customers or POS staff.
- **Active:** Fully published. It can be searched, added to carts, and sold. Requires at least one active variant and price.
- **Archived:** Temporarily hidden. Usually for seasonal items or discontinued stock that still requires historical reporting.
- **Soft Deleted:** Moved to the recycle bin. Retained for 7 days before permanent deletion to prevent accidental data loss.
- **Permanent Delete:** Completely purged from the database. Allowed only if the product has zero historical transaction ties.

### Examples
- **Example A:** A summer t-shirt is marked as *Active* in May. By October, it is marked as *Archived*.
- **Example B:** A data entry error creates a duplicate product. The admin soft-deletes it immediately, and the cron job permanently deletes it a week later.

### Edge Cases
- **Active but out of stock:** The product is active but cannot be sold. The frontend must handle this gracefully (e.g., "Out of Stock" badge).
- **Archiving a product in a pending order:** If a product is archived while in a customer's pending cart, the checkout must block the purchase.

### Integrity Issues & Suggested Fixes
- **Issue:** Attempting to hard-delete a product that has foreign key constraints in `order_items` or `inventory_movements`.
- **Suggested Fix:** Implement a strict `Restrict` deletion rule on the database level. Add a pre-flight check in the backend that forces an `Archive` instead of `Delete` if transaction history exists.

## 2. Inventory Reservation Lifecycle

The most critical lifecycle in preventing overselling. It tracks the commitment of stock before it is physically removed from the master inventory.

### Flowchart
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> AvailableStock
    AvailableStock --> ReservationCommitment: Order Placed (Pending)
    ReservationCommitment --> AvailableStock: Order Cancelled / Timeout
    ReservationCommitment --> PhysicalDeduction: Order Scanned & Fulfilled
    PhysicalDeduction --> [*]
```

### Detailed Phases
- **Commitment (Reservation):** When an order is placed (E-commerce or Social), the requested quantity is reserved. `available_quantity` decreases, but `physical_quantity` remains unchanged.
- **Deduction (Physical Movement):** When the warehouse or store staff scans the barcode to fulfill the order, the reserved quantity is consumed, and `physical_quantity` decreases.

### Examples
- **Example A:** A store has 10 units. A customer orders 2 online. Available stock becomes 8. Reserved stock becomes 2. Physical stock remains 10. Once dispatched, reserved becomes 0, physical becomes 8.

### Edge Cases
- **Simultaneous Checkout:** Two users attempt to buy the last unit at the exact same millisecond.
- **Abandoned Carts:** Stock is reserved but never paid for, leading to artificial scarcity.

### Integrity Issues & Suggested Fixes
- **Issue:** Race conditions during reservation. If two requests read `available_quantity = 1` concurrently, both might succeed, causing overselling.
- **Suggested Fix (Antigravity prompt):** "Implement optimistic locking or a DB transaction with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` when reading `available_quantity` during order placement to prevent race conditions. Also, ensure a background job releases reservations for unpaid orders after 15 minutes."

## 3. Product Batch Lifecycle

Batches group products by manufacturing or expiry dates, crucial for FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) or perishables.

### Flowchart
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Active
    Active --> Available: QC Passed
    Available --> LowStock: Stock < Threshold
    Available --> ExpiringSoon: CurrentDate >= Expiry - 30 days
    ExpiringSoon --> Expired: CurrentDate >= Expiry
    Expired --> Disposed: Removed from System
```

### Detailed Phases
- **Active:** Batch created upon receiving a Purchase Order.
- **Available:** Cleared for sale. POS and E-commerce allocate stock from the oldest available batch first (FIFO).
- **Low Stock:** Batch quantity falls below the store's defined threshold.
- **Expiring Soon:** System triggers an alert when the batch is within X days of its expiry date.
- **Expired:** Automatically blocked from being added to new orders or POS sales.

### Examples
- **Example A:** Batch B-101 of Face Cream is received. It expires in 6 months. After 5 months, it shifts to *Expiring Soon*, prompting a discount promotion.

### Edge Cases
- **Returning an expired product:** A customer returns a product that expired after they bought it. The system must not add it back to *Available* stock.

### Integrity Issues & Suggested Fixes
- **Issue:** Expired batches still appearing in the E-commerce available pool if the cron job fails to update their status.
- **Suggested Fix:** Instead of relying solely on cron jobs, calculate batch availability dynamically via a database view or an accessor `is_expired` based on `CURRENT_DATE`.

## 4. Barcode Tracking Lifecycle

Each unique item (or SKU) is tracked via barcodes for precise location management within the multi-store ecosystem.

### Flowchart
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Generated
    Generated --> Printed: QZ Tray
    Printed --> Scanned_In: Received at Store
    Scanned_In --> CurrentLocation: Assigned to Bin/Shelf
    CurrentLocation --> MovementHistory: Transferred
    CurrentLocation --> Scanned_Out: Sold / Fulfilled
    MovementHistory --> Stagnant: No movement > 90 days
```

### Detailed Phases
- **Scan:** The physical action of reading the barcode. Initializes a state change.
- **Current Location:** Defines exactly which branch, warehouse, or shelf the item currently resides.
- **Movement History:** An append-only log of every location change for the barcode.
- **Stagnant:** A soft state indicating the item hasn't moved or been sold in a defined period, triggering a rebalancing suggestion.

### Examples
- **Example A:** Barcode `12345` is printed. It is scanned into Store A. Two weeks later, it is scanned out via POS. Movement history logs: Generated -> Store A -> Sold.

### Edge Cases
- **Damaged Barcode:** A barcode is unreadable, requiring manual entry which might lead to typos.
- **Duplicate Scans:** Scanning the same barcode twice during a transfer.

### Integrity Issues & Suggested Fixes
- **Issue:** Barcode stagnation logic is heavy to compute on the fly for millions of rows.
- **Suggested Fix:** Create an aggregated table `barcode_stagnation_metrics` updated nightly, indexing `last_movement_date` to quickly identify stagnant inventory.

## 5. Product Dispatch Lifecycle (Internal Transfer)

Governs the movement of inventory between branches or warehouses.

### Flowchart
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Create
    Create --> Approve: Manager Approval
    Approve --> ScanSource: Items Picked
    ScanSource --> Dispatch: In Transit
    Dispatch --> ReceiveDestination: Arrived
    ReceiveDestination --> Deliver: Stock Updated
    Deliver --> [*]
```

### Detailed Phases
- **Create:** Store A requests stock from Warehouse.
- **Approve:** Warehouse manager approves the request.
- **Scan (Source):** Warehouse staff scans items into a dispatch box. Stock is deducted from the source's physical inventory.
- **Dispatch:** Status changes to In Transit. Items exist in a "limbo" virtual location.
- **Receive (Destination) & Deliver:** Store A scans items upon arrival. Stock is added to Store A's physical inventory.

### Examples
- **Example A:** Store A needs 50 units. Warehouse dispatches them. While in transit, they are not sellable. Upon receiving, Store A's stock increases by 50.

### Edge Cases
- **Loss in Transit:** Only 48 of 50 units arrive. The receiving store must log a discrepancy, moving 2 units to a "Lost/Damage" holding account.

### Integrity Issues & Suggested Fixes
- **Issue:** If the system crashes between `ScanSource` and `Dispatch`, stock might be deducted from the source but never placed in the transit state.
- **Suggested Fix:** Wrap the deduction and transit-creation logic in a rigid database transaction. Implement an automated reconciliation report to catch floating transit stock older than 14 days.

## 6. Inventory Rebalancing Lifecycle

The process of optimizing stock distribution across branches to prevent dead stock in one store and stockouts in another.

### Flowchart
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Suggestion: AI/Cron Triggered
    Suggestion --> Create: Draft Transfer
    Create --> Approve: Area Manager Approves
    Create --> Reject: Discarded
    Approve --> DispatchLifecycle
    DispatchLifecycle --> Complete
```

### Detailed Phases
- **Suggestion:** Algorithm identifies Store A has stagnant stock while Store B has high demand.
- **Create & Approve:** Human oversight to validate the AI suggestion.
- **Complete:** Finalized once the physical dispatch lifecycle finishes.

### Examples
- **Example A:** Store A hasn't sold winter coats in 2 months. Store B in a colder region is out of stock. A rebalance is suggested and executed.

### Edge Cases
- **Suggestion out of date:** By the time the manager approves the rebalance (e.g., 3 days later), Store A might have sold the stock.

### Integrity Issues & Suggested Fixes
- **Issue:** Rebalancing suggestions based on stale data.
- **Suggested Fix:** Re-verify `available_quantity` dynamically at the exact moment of manager approval. If stock has changed, auto-adjust or abort the rebalancing order.

## 7. Defective Product Lifecycle

Handling items that are damaged, expired, or returned in poor condition.

### Flowchart
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> MarkDefective
    MarkDefective --> Inspect: QA Check
    Inspect --> AvailableForSale: False Alarm / Refurbished
    Inspect --> SellAtDiscount: Minor Defect
    Inspect --> Dispose: Unsalvageable
    Inspect --> ReturnToVendor: Manufacturer Fault
```

### Detailed Phases
- **Mark Defective:** Item removed from available stock and placed in a quarantine status.
- **Inspect:** Staff evaluates the condition.
- **Outcomes:** It can be restored to stock, sold at a discount (clearance), permanently disposed of (written off), or returned to the vendor for a refund.

### Examples
- **Example A:** A customer returns a scratched monitor. It is marked defective, inspected, and then moved to a clearance sale category at a 30% discount.

### Edge Cases
- **Vendor refuses return:** The lifecycle must branch from *ReturnToVendor* back to *Dispose* if the vendor rejects the claim.

### Integrity Issues & Suggested Fixes
- **Issue:** Financial tracking of disposed items. Disposing an item removes it from inventory but might not automatically create an accounting expense entry.
- **Suggested Fix:** Ensure the `Dispose` action triggers an event listener (`ProductDisposedEvent`) that automatically posts a journal entry to the "Inventory Write-off" expense account.

## 8. Product Image Lifecycle

Managing media assets for the catalog.

### Flowchart
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Upload
    Upload --> Processing: Compress/WebP
    Processing --> Active: Available
    Active --> Reorder: Position Change
    Active --> MakePrimary: Set as Thumbnail
    Active --> Inactive: Toggle Visibility
```

### Detailed Phases
- **Upload:** Admin uploads raw images.
- **Processing:** Background task to resize and convert to WebP.
- **Reorder & Make Primary:** Determining display hierarchy.
- **Toggle Active:** Hiding an image without deleting the file.

### Examples
- **Example A:** A new product gets 5 images. One is set as primary. A seasonal image is later toggled to inactive after the season ends.

### Edge Cases
- **Primary Image Deletion:** If the primary image is deleted, the system must automatically fall back to the next active image in the order sequence.

### Integrity Issues & Suggested Fixes
- **Issue:** Orphaned files in cloud storage (S3/Local) when images are deleted from the database.
- **Suggested Fix:** When deleting an image record, dispatch a delayed background job to delete the physical file from the storage disk to prevent storage bloat.
